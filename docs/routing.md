# Routing and rotation

How TeamClaude decides which account serves a request, and what it does when that account runs out.

## Request lifecycle

1. Claude Code connects to the local proxy instead of `api.anthropic.com`.
2. The proxy selects the active account and forwards requests with that account's credentials.
3. OAuth tokens expiring within 5 minutes are automatically refreshed and persisted to config.
4. Rate limit headers from the API (`anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*`) track session (5h) and weekly (7d) quota utilization.
5. When usage reaches the threshold, the proxy switches to the best available account (see [Choosing an account](#choosing-an-account)).
6. On 429 responses, the proxy waits the `retry-after` duration and retries; on persistent errors, it switches accounts.
7. Transient network errors (connection reset, timeout) drop the connection so the client can retry.
8. If all accounts are exhausted, returns 429 with the soonest reset time — or, with [`holdSeconds`](quota.md#hold-on-exhaustion) set, holds the connection open and retries silently until an account recovers.
9. Client token refresh requests (`/v1/oauth/token`) are relayed to upstream untouched — the proxy and client manage their own token lifecycles independently.

## Choosing an account

TeamClaude prefers to keep you on one account. It stays on the current one and only rotates when that account nears `switchThreshold` (default `0.98`).

When it does have to pick, ranking is: lowest `priority` number first, then, among accounts of equal priority, the one whose governing weekly bucket resets soonest. Spending the account closest to its refresh preserves the ones whose window resets further out. A model with its own weekly bucket (Fable, Sonnet) is ranked by that bucket rather than the shared one. Set an explicit order with `teamclaude priority <name> <n>`, or `--first` / `--last`.

## The two kinds of 429

Reacting the wrong way to either one makes things worse, so they are handled separately.

- A **quota rejection** (a spent 5h or weekly bucket, `unified-…-status: rejected`) switches accounts immediately.
- A **rate-limit 429** (the per-minute throttle) does **not** switch. It pauses the account so concurrent requests wait instead of flooding, retries the same account (absorbing short `retry-after`s inline, default ≤ 60s via `TEAMCLAUDE_RATE_LIMIT_ABSORB_MAX_SECONDS`), and only surfaces a 429 to the client for longer waits.

Rotating on a rate-limit 429 would just move the burst to the next account and throw away the first account's prompt cache.

## OAuth entitlement denials

A `403` whose structured error code is `error.details.error_code: oauth_not_allowed_for_organization` means the selected account's organization does not permit OAuth authentication. TeamClaude fails the current request over to another account and keeps the denied account out of automatic rotation for five minutes. The cooldown is shared by later requests, is not persisted, and expires automatically so an organization policy change can recover without restarting the proxy. Other `403` responses still fail over for that request but do not quarantine the account.

If every configured account returns that exact denial, TeamClaude's terminal `502` says that no account served the request, names the denied accounts and error code, and recommends waiting for automatic re-admission or pinning a different eligible account. It does not recommend `teamclaude login`, which remains the diagnostic for a generic credential refusal.

An explicit [`TC_ACCT` pin](#pin-a-session-to-one-account) continues to target exactly the requested account and never fails over, even while that account is excluded from automatic rotation.

## One failover hop on a rate limit

A **quota rejection** (a 429 carrying `...unified-*-status: rejected`) is durable
exhaustion and rotates, as it always has. A plain **rate-limit 429** does not
rotate as a policy — moving a shared burst to the next account just throttles
that one too and discards the first account's prompt cache.

That reasoning holds under load. It does not hold when a sibling is sitting
idle, which is the common shape for a small fleet of personal subscriptions: one
account throttled, another at 9% weekly, and the whole proxy stalling for 60s at
a time.

So a rate-limit 429 takes **one** failover hop, onto an account that is not
already tried and not inside its own 429 pause. The same single hop applies to
an upstream **5xx** (`529 Overloaded` above all), which is the provider
declining to serve rather than anything about the account.

One hop, not a walk of the fleet, and the reason is worth knowing: **if the
second account is rate-limited too, the limit is almost certainly scoped to the
egress IP rather than to either account** — every account leaves from the same
address. Continuing to rotate would prove nothing and pay a cold cache for each
attempt. After the hop the existing behaviour takes over: the sx.org fresh-IP
retry if `sx.mode` is `429`, otherwise the inline wait, otherwise a 429 to the
client with its `retry-after`. An IP-scoped limit is logged as such, since that
is what an operator chasing a fleet-wide throttle is looking for.

## Storm control

When you run many agents at once and the active account runs out, every in-flight request fails over to the next account **at the same instant** — a thundering herd that can spend a big chunk of the fresh account's quota (large contexts) and instantly throttle it, cascading down the fleet ([#84](https://github.com/KarpelesLab/teamclaude/issues/84)).

To prevent this, requests onto a **just-switched-to account** are paced: concurrency starts at 1 and the cap ramps up over a few seconds, then lifts. The first request or two reveal whether the new account is also near-exhausted **before** the whole herd commits to it, so a cascade is broken up hop by hop. The gate is **fail-open** — a request never blocks longer than the ramp window, and a client that disconnects while waiting just drops out — and the slot is held only until response headers arrive, so streaming replies don't tie up concurrency.

On by default. Tune or disable via `stormRamp` in the config:

```json
"stormRamp": { "enabled": true, "startConc": 1, "stepConc": 1, "stepMs": 250, "windowMs": 30000 }
```

- **`startConc`** — concurrent requests allowed the instant a switch happens (default 1).
- **`stepConc`** / **`stepMs`** — the cap grows by `stepConc` every `stepMs` (default +1 every 250ms ≈ 4 req/s).
- **`windowMs`** — after this long, pacing stops entirely (default 30s).
- **`enabled: false`** — turn storm control off (send the full burst immediately, pre-#84 behavior).

The same gate handles rate-limit 429s: TeamClaude pauses the account for the `retry-after` window so new queries wait instead of piling on, then releases the held queries through a fresh ramp (staggered, not all at once).

## Model-aware routing

The per-model weekly cap (e.g. Fable) is tracked separately, so an account whose Fable quota is spent is skipped **only** for Fable requests and still serves Opus/Sonnet. **Eligibility for a family model takes the higher of that family's bucket and the shared weekly one**, because family spend meters twice, once in the family bucket and once in the shared one. An account already past its shared weekly cap is therefore unavailable for family traffic too, rather than continuing to serve it and pushing the shared bucket further past the cap. The reverse still holds: a spent *family* bucket bars only that family. One consequence worth knowing: on the weekly buckets the family gate is the stricter of the two, so an account whose weekly quota lets it serve Fable can also serve Opus. That is a statement about quota only, since a `routes` pin or a blocklist can still make an account ineligible for one model and not the other. Requests are routed by their `model`, read exactly from the request body in both base-URL and MITM modes. `teamclaude status` shows this per account (a `Models` line) and any families it detects appear as **auto** routes.

Advisor requests (Claude Code's `/advisor`) carry a **second** model nested in the tools array. Routing sees it too, so the request lands on an account eligible for both the main model and the advisor, falling back to main-model-only routing when no account can serve both.

Unwanted models can be rejected outright with [`blockedModels`](configuration.md#fields) instead of being forwarded — a model no account can serve otherwise gets rate-limited upstream and hangs the pipeline.

## Model routes

Per-model quota is respected automatically, so most setups need nothing here. To go further you can pin model patterns to an **exclusive** set of accounts with a `routes` table. Each route matches the request's `model` id against shell-style globs (`*` is the only wildcard) and, on the **first matching** route, restricts the request to the listed accounts:

```json
"routes": [
  { "name": "fable", "match": ["*fable*"], "accounts": ["personal-max"], "color": "magenta" },
  { "name": "bulk",  "match": ["*opus*", "*sonnet*"], "accounts": ["corp-1", "corp-2"], "color": "blue" }
]
```

- **`match`** — one or more model globs; the first route whose globs match wins.
- **`accounts`** — account names (or indices) that may serve matching models. **Exclusive**: only these are used (and they 429/rotate among themselves when spent). Omit to route to all accounts — e.g. to only set a `bucket` override.
- **`bucket`** — optional: force which quota bucket governs eligibility (`unified7dFable`, `unified7dSonnet`, `unified7d`), for the rare case the family can't be inferred from the model id.
- **`color`** — optional: `red`/`green`/`yellow`/`blue`/`magenta`/`cyan`, tinting this route's inline marker in the TUI. Display only.

Manage routes from the shell (changes apply to a running server immediately):

```bash
teamclaude route list
teamclaude route add fable --match '*fable*' --accounts personal-max --color magenta
teamclaude route add bulk  --match '*opus*,*sonnet*' --accounts corp-1,corp-2
teamclaude route rm fable
```

…or interactively in the TUI: open settings (**`g`**) → **Manage routing**, then `a` add / `e` edit / `d` delete (the editor prompts for a marker color too).

**Inline markers (TUI).** Instead of a separate list, each route surfaces on the account rows as a colored `►`: next to the **`F7`**/**`S7`** bar for a Fable/Sonnet route, or at the **start of the row** for a general route (one fixed column per route so its position is stable). The marker is bold on the account a route is pinned to, dim when that account is currently ineligible. `teamclaude status` still prints the routes as a list, colored and annotated with any pin.

**Manual per-route switching (TUI).** Press **`s`** to switch accounts, then **`←`**/**`→`** (or **`Tab`**) to choose *what* you're switching: the global **default** account, or a specific **route**. Pick an account with `↑`/`↓` and **`Enter`** to pin that route to it; `Enter` again on the current pin clears it. Pins are a **runtime preference** — not saved to config — and routing **falls back** to normal best-available selection whenever the pinned account is throttled or over quota, so a pin never stalls requests.

## Session-aware routing

TeamClaude always tracks running Claude Code sessions by their `x-claude-code-session-id` header — the TUI header and `teamclaude status` show how many are **active** (a request in flight right now, or seen in the last ~2 min) and **known** (seen in the last hour; sessions are forgotten after an hour idle, the maximum prompt-cache extension window). A long streaming request keeps its session active and non-expirable for its whole duration, so a multi-minute completion still counts as load. This is passive: it observes, it doesn't change routing.

Default rotation is purely quota-driven, so many parallel sessions all pile onto the *current* account while equal-priority siblings sit idle — one account queues behind its upstream concurrency ceiling while others do nothing ([#109](https://github.com/KarpelesLab/teamclaude/issues/109)). Enable `distributeSessions` to fix that:

```json
"distributeSessions": true
```

When on, TeamClaude routes each **new** session to the least-loaded eligible account (fewest active sessions, then fewest in-flight) and **pins** it there for the model family's weekly quota bucket, so a session keeps hitting the same account for that family and preserves its prompt cache — while different sessions spread across accounts instead of funnelling onto one. Account **priority still wins** (a higher-priority account is never skipped to balance load), and a session whose account becomes exhausted re-routes automatically. Off by default; single-session use is unaffected either way.

More precisely, a session holds **one pin per weekly quota bucket**, not one overall, because eligibility is decided per bucket: an account whose Fable weekly is spent still serves Opus. So a Fable request that has to divert elsewhere leaves the session's Opus pin where it is, and each family with its **own** bucket keeps its own cache affinity. The consequence is that a session using two families commonly sits on two accounts, and the per-account session counts in `teamclaude status` can therefore add up to more than the number of active sessions.

**Families that share a bucket share a pin, including when only one of them is separately metered.** Upstream can report a *learned* weekly bucket scoped to a family the static table has no entry for; routing then meters that family on its own window (see [Expiry-pressure routing](#expiry-pressure-routing)) while affinity still keys on the shared bucket the family falls under. Such a family has its own quota clock and not its own pin, so anything that moves the pin moves both — a known limitation of pinning by bucket rather than by governing window, and the reason the cost bound below is stated per pin rather than per family.

**Turning it off drains, it doesn't cut.** The setting is applied live on config reload, and switching it off would otherwise move every distributed session to the current account on its *next* request — each one throwing away the prompt cache it built on its old account, and all of them arriving at one account at once. Instead, the sessions running at that moment keep their accounts, and only **new** sessions go back to plain quota-driven rotation. Affinity therefore winds down as those sessions finish rather than snapping, and a draining session whose account becomes ineligible simply rejoins normal rotation. While this is happening `teamclaude status` reads `draining N` (the TUI header shows `drain N`) instead of `single-account`, and it clears itself once the last of those sessions is done or idles out.

With `expiryRouting.preempt` on, a governing-window **rollover** also ends the drain for the session whose account rolled, and it rejoins normal rotation there and then. The drain trades expiring quota for a warm prompt cache, and that trade is priced on the window the account had when the drain started; once that window has gained a full week the account is the one the fleet should be spending last. Nothing else bounds it — a session making requests never idles out — so without this a long-lived session rides a rolled-over account for as long as it keeps talking.

## Routing strategies

The `routingStrategy` config key selects how TeamClaude ranks and rotates accounts across requests:

```json
"routingStrategy": "expiry"
```

Three strategies are supported:

- **`"expiry"` (default)** — Prioritizes spending quota that is closest to expiring unspent. Ranks accounts by expiry pressure (headroom divided by time to reset). See [Expiry-pressure routing](#expiry-pressure-routing).
- **`"balanced"`** — Distributes weekly quota across accounts. Ranks candidate accounts by weekly utilization ascending (lowest-utilized first), and moves the cursor when an available candidate's weekly utilization is lower than current by at least `weeklyBalanceMargin`. See [Balanced routing](#balanced-routing).
- **`"drain"`** — Inert strategy. Disables dynamic pressure ranking and banding; accounts remain parked on the current account until the switch threshold, falling back to priority and config order.

### Orthogonality of `routingStrategy` and `expiryRouting`

`routingStrategy` and `expiryRouting.enabled` are orthogonal switches, not a precedence hierarchy:

- `routingStrategy` controls the ranking and preemption function (`expiry`, `balanced`, or `drain`).
- Under `"balanced"`, expiry pressure banding is explicitly **passthrough** (all candidates remain eligible rather than being narrowed by expiry pressure), and expiry-specific rollover preemption and session-quota reset switches are deactivated because the margin already steers traffic toward rolled, low-utilization accounts.
- The sub-knobs in `expiryRouting` (`tolerance`, `preempt`) apply when `routingStrategy` is `"expiry"`.

## Balanced routing

Under `routingStrategy: "balanced"`, TeamClaude distributes spend across accounts to prevent multi-day utilization skew:

```json
"routingStrategy": "balanced",
"weeklyBalanceMargin": 0.10
```

### Scope and trade-offs

Balanced routing fixes **weekly distribution** across multiple accounts.

**It does NOT fix the 5-hour session quota wall.** Total 5-hour capacity across the fleet is policy-independent; if aggregate demand exceeds fleet capacity, accounts will still exhaust their 5-hour windows. Furthermore, balanced routing rotates across accounts more frequently than single-account drain, and each rotation incurs a prompt-cache miss and re-write turn on the new account. Consequently, balanced routing plausibly makes intraday 5-hour performance slightly worse in exchange for more even weekly distribution. That trade-off is unmeasured.

### How balanced ranking and margin preemption work

1. **Model-dependent ranking:** When selecting which account serves a request, candidate accounts are ranked by `_governingWindow(account, model).utilization` ascending (lowest-utilized first). A model with its own weekly bucket (such as Fable or Sonnet) ranks accounts based on that model's bucket.
2. **Model-independent margin preemption:** To prevent flapping between accounts with opposing model utilization (e.g. account A low on Sonnet but high on Fable, and account B vice versa), cursor movement is gated by a model-independent weekly utilization scalar `W` computed across each provider's accounts (`unified7d` -> max of family buckets -> fleet median).
3. **Margin threshold (`weeklyBalanceMargin`):** Selection moves the cursor to the best available candidate only when `W(current) - W(best) >= weeklyBalanceMargin`. Default is `0.10`.
   - **Floor clamp (`>= 0.02`):** `weeklyBalanceMargin` is clamped to at least `0.02`, and values below `0.05` log a startup warning. Upstream quota updates arrive in 0.01 quanta. An un-clamped margin (such as 0 or 0.01) would move the cursor on a 1% differential, causing constant rotation and prompt-cache thrashing. Clamping strictly above zero guarantees cycle-freedom and bounds rotation churn.
4. **Spill guards:** Margin preemption will not move the cursor if the candidate account's 5-hour session bucket sits at `unified5h >= 0.90` (preserving headroom for high-demand bursts) or if the candidate is paused.

### Observability on `/status`

Under balanced routing, `teamclaude status --json` (and `GET /teamclaude/status`) exposes:

- **`routingStrategy`** — the active strategy (`"balanced"`, `"expiry"`, or `"drain"`).
- **`weeklyBalanceMargin`** — the effective clamped balance margin.
- **`accounts[].W`** — each account's model-independent weekly balance metric `{ value, provenance }` (`provenance`: `'unified'`, `'family-proxy'`, `'median'`, or `'empty'`).
- **`spread`** — per-provider `max(W) - min(W)` utilization spread, designed for alerting (e.g. spread >= margin sustained for > 2 hours with zero moves).
- **`marginMove`** — counters tracking the outcomes of margin preemption evaluations:
  - `done`: margin preemption successfully rotated the cursor to a lower-W candidate.
  - `blocked_5h`: candidate had >= margin advantage but was blocked because `unified5h >= 0.90`.
  - `blocked_paused`: candidate had >= margin advantage but is paused.
  - `below_margin`: best candidate's W was not lower than current W by at least `weeklyBalanceMargin`.
  - `self_best`: current account already ranks best (or no candidate available) in steady state.

## Expiry-pressure routing

The soonest-reset preference in [Choosing an account](#choosing-an-account) only applies at the moments selection *has* to pick — daemon start and threshold rotation. On a fleet whose weekly utilization never reaches the threshold, those moments never come: routing can sit on the account whose window just reset a full week out while another account's ample weekly quota quietly expires unspent. Enable `expiryRouting` to make the horizon a standing preference instead:

```json
"expiryRouting": { "enabled": true, "tolerance": 1.5, "preempt": true }
```

Each account gets a **pressure** score for the request's model: headroom in the governing weekly bucket divided by the seconds until that bucket resets. High pressure means ample quota about to be forfeited — spend it first. Because headroom is the numerator, a nearly-drained account is *not* preferred merely because its window rolls soon (reset time alone would steer into it). Both halves come from the **same** bucket: an account reporting a Fable utilization but no Fable window is not given the shared window's horizon instead, since dividing one bucket's headroom by another bucket's clock ranks an account on quota it does not have. Fable/Sonnet requests are therefore scored on their own weekly bucket, so the same account can rank differently per model. A family with no dedicated bucket is scored on whichever binds it — the shared weekly, or a weekly bucket upstream reports scoped to that family, the same tighter-of-the-two the availability gate uses — so a learned bucket the family table has never heard of cannot be spent past while the shared window still looks roomy. The 5h bucket is not scored — it stays an availability gate, since its much shorter horizon would otherwise numerically drown the weekly comparison this feature exists to make. `teamclaude status --json` reports each account's computed `pressure` (against the shared weekly), so you can see the ordering the router is working from.

An account whose governing bucket is not fully reported is handled in two separate steps, and they do not answer the same way.

**Admission is unconditional.** Such an account stays in the band rather than being filtered out of it, whichever half of the reading is missing: being used is how that quota becomes known, so banding it out would make the unknown permanent. This mirrors the existing unknown-reset probe bias.

**Ranking depends on what is actually known.** A bucket reporting no utilization at all is a genuine unknown and ranks at the top of the band, for the reason just given. A bucket whose utilization *is* reported but whose window is not is a different case: the headroom is known and only the clock is missing, so it is ranked by a **lower bound** on its pressure — the score it would have if that window were resetting as late as a weekly window can, a full seven days out. A real window resets no later than that, so the bound can only understate, and such an account is never preferred over a measured one on the strength of a number nobody reported. Ranking it as a genuine unknown instead would put an account 95% through its Fable quota ahead of one holding 95% of that quota with an hour left to spend it.

Selection then draws from the **top pressure band**: accounts within `tolerance` (a ratio, ≥ 1) of the best pressure in the top priority tier. Inside the band the usual rules apply unchanged — `distributeSessions` still spreads new sessions by load, priority still wins, and the storm ramp still paces failover. `tolerance` is the dial between load spreading and expiry pressure: large values approach pure load-balancing, `1.0` is strict highest-pressure-first (and effectively disables session spreading).

With `preempt` on, a **pinned session** (and the sticky current account) is re-routed when its account's governing weekly window **rolls over** — the account just became both the freshest and the furthest-dated choice, so staying would burn the window that gained a full week while sooner-expiring quota goes unspent. That rollover is the only thing **this feature** does to a pin. Pressure on its own never moves one, and neither does the pinned account's quota draining — that is the policy working, and re-routing on it would thrash the prompt cache for nothing. Everything that moved a pin before still does, unchanged. A pin **stops being honoured** when the account cannot serve the request (every reason `teamclaude status` names on its **Blocked** line, from spent quota through a rate-limit hold to an upstream refusal), when a higher-priority account is available, or when that account was already tried and failed earlier in the same request. A pin is **bypassed outright** by a manual route pin and by a `/tc-acct/` (`TC_ACCT`) override, both of which resolve before session affinity is consulted at all. And a pin can simply **cease to exist**: removing an account deletes the pins that named it, and a session idle past the known window is forgotten along with all of them. (That enumeration is the three writers of a session's pin map — `touch`, `remapAccounts`, and record expiry — plus the two paths that resolve ahead of affinity; it is the search, not a recollection.) Cost of the rollover itself: at most one cache-miss turn per PIN per rollover of the window that pin is measured on, roughly once per account per week.

**A rollover is measured against what the last request read where it came to rest**, and that is the whole of the state involved: one reading per pin (and one for the sticky current account), taken when a request arrives to find the pin already on an account. A selection that *sends* a request somewhere takes no reading it could lose one by: it writes only where there is nothing to lose — a choice that has never named an account, or one whose account has rolled no window it recorded — because the request may not arrive. And the roll a preemption pushes traffic off is **held** rather than dropped until a second request confirms the stay at the destination, so a preemption whose destination refuses it, and which then falls back onto the account it was pushed off, finds the rollover still there and moves again as soon as anywhere better is available. That holds through a retry that never leaves the destination — a short-wait 429 and a 401 both re-enter selection on the same account — which otherwise reads as a completed stay. The bound that follows is worth stating plainly: **a rollover that happens before anything has read that account is not detected.** That window is one request wide and it is the same one every first placement has — a session's opening account, a rotation's destination, an operator's switch — so in practice it costs the account's *next* roll rather than this one. Holding the origin's roll for one request longer has a bound of its own and it is the mirror of that one: traffic that rests at the destination for exactly one request and then returns to the account that rolled is preempted off it once more, because the stay was never confirmed. Where a learned scoped window shares a pin with the bucket it falls under (see above), that one turn is paid by every family on the pin, not only by the family whose window rolled. A rollover that moves nothing logs a line saying which of the two reasons it was — no eligible account could take the traffic, or the re-rank ran and the account it was already on still ranked best — because a stuck preemption otherwise looks exactly like no rollover at all, and like the ordering simply agreeing that staying is right.

With `"preempt": false` the band only refines the moments selection was already going to pick — a rotation, or placing a new session — so the "standing preference" above is really a property of `preempt: true`. Without it, the sticky current account (distribution off) or an existing session pin stays where it is across a rollover, and long-lived sessions can still ride an account whose window just reset a week out.

Off by default. With the knob off, every routing decision is byte-identical to the one the router makes without this feature. The one addition either way is the status payload: `teamclaude status --json` gains an `expiryRouting` echo of the resolved settings and a per-account `pressure` figure whether the knob is on or off, since pressure is a measurement of the fleet rather than a report of the feature's state. Changes apply to a running server via `POST /teamclaude/reload` (or any CLI command that notifies the server). **Off means there is no state at all**, and that is what makes the byte-identity promise checkable rather than a rule every reader has to remember: no reading is taken while preemption is off, and every reading is dropped the moment it is turned off. Switching it back on takes a fresh reading for the current account and for every live session pin — including any that a reload turning `distributeSessions` off in the same pass has just put into the drain, whose only bound is the rollover above — so the fleet is measured from the reload rather than from its next roll. The cost of that lifetime is stated rather than hidden: **a rollover that happens while the feature is off is not carried across.** It was not being watched for, and the alternative is mechanism state that outlives the knob.

One limitation belongs to the router rather than to this feature, recorded here because it is easy to attribute to it: a **status preview** that runs before a request clears an expired 5-hour window, and the account switch that reset calls for is skipped, because the switch acts on the resets its own pass observed. That holds with the knob off and on alike. **A TUI paint is not that case and does not skip it**: the paint calls the combined clear-and-switch, so it performs the switch itself — with no request in hand, and therefore on the model-less ranking, where a request's own refresh ranks on the window that governs it. Both halves are base behaviour, measured on both surfaces.

## Pin a session to one account

`TC_ACCT` forces every request onto **one** account, bypassing rotation (and never failing over to another). It works in **both** modes — MITM (the default) and `--no-mitm`:

```bash
# By email — what you'll normally use
TC_ACCT=me@example.com teamclaude run

# By accountUuid — stable across renames; `teamclaude accounts` prints it
TC_ACCT=a1b2c3d4-… teamclaude run
```

`TC_ACCT` is read by `teamclaude run` and **removed from the environment before claude is launched** — it never reaches the client or anything it spawns. Under `--no-mitm` TeamClaude builds the pinned base URL itself; under MITM it travels as the proxy credential on each `CONNECT`, which is the only pin channel an `HTTPS_PROXY` URL can carry. Either way you don't hand-write a URL.

`teamclaude env` honours it identically, so a tool that spawns claude itself gets the same pin:

```bash
TC_ACCT=me@example.com eval "$(teamclaude env)"
```

The value matches an `accountUuid`, an `orgUuid`, or a display name/email, first match wins. No escaping needed; spaces, `@` and parens are handled for you. An unknown value is refused by the proxy with a `404` rather than quietly served by whichever account rotation picked. That refusal happens on the first request, not at launch, so a typo shows up as a failing claude rather than a wrong account.

Prefer the `accountUuid` (printed by `teamclaude accounts`) for anything scripted: display names are rewritten in place, since an account is named by its email and gains an ` (Org)` suffix the moment that email holds a second org.

The rotation index is **not** accepted — it is array position, so deleting an account would silently repoint every later pin at a *different* account.

> If you hold the *same* account in two orgs, a bare uuid or email matches the first one. `TC_ACCT=<accountUuid>/<orgUuid>` picks a specific one — rarely needed.

<details>
<summary>Pinning without <code>teamclaude run</code> (<code>/tc-acct/</code>, deprecated)</summary>

**Deprecated** — use `TC_ACCT` instead. The path-prefix form cannot work in MITM mode (inside a CONNECT tunnel the path is the real upstream one), so it only covers half the product. It still works for keep-warm's internal use and for calling the proxy directly:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3456/tc-acct/1/v1/messages \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: <your teamclaude proxy key>' \
  -d '{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","max_tokens":16,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'
```

URL-encode spaces and parens in a name here. The fully-qualified `accountUuid/orgUuid` form is **not** expressible in a path (the `/` is the delimiter) — use `TC_ACCT` for that. An unknown pin returns `404`. The prefix is stripped before the request is forwarded upstream.

</details>

## Prompt caching across rotation

Rotation is transparent to your Claude Code session, but it's worth knowing how it interacts with Anthropic's [prompt cache](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching).

- **Your context is never lost.** Claude Code resends the full transcript every turn, and TeamClaude rewrites the request's `account_uuid` to match the injected token, so whichever account serves a turn sees the complete history — a mid-session switch is invisible to the client.
- **The cache doesn't carry across accounts.** The prompt cache is scoped to the account/organization that created it and expires after a few minutes, so the first turn after a switch is a cache **miss** — that turn is processed without the cache discount, after which the new account warms its own cache. No proxy can share a cache across organizations.

In practice this rarely bites, because TeamClaude prefers to keep you on one account (see [Choosing an account](#choosing-an-account)) — a single account tends to serve a whole session and switches are infrequent.

> [Keep-warm](quota.md#keep-warm) is unrelated to this — it starts an idle account's **5h session timer**, not its prompt cache. A freshly-rotated account still takes a one-turn cache miss regardless.
