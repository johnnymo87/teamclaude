   * nothing. A fleet-wide median would let one provider's numbers manufacture a

   * plus two cheap Codex accounts at {0.05, 0.08} gives a fleet median ~0.25,
   * which an unprobed Anthropic account inherits, becoming best; the cursor moves
   * onto it, it probes at 0.95, and the cursor moves straight back — two prompt-
   * cache storms manufactured by another provider's numbers.
   *
   * Why 0 / 'empty' is safe as the per-provider floor even though W=0 reads as
   * "completely unspent" and would normally be maximally attractive: if a group
   * has nothing resolved, every member gets the same constant, so all
   * within-group W differences are 0 and no margin move can fire. "Maximally
   * attractive" only bites against known values, which by construction do not
   * exist in that group.
   *
   * Algorithm, applied independently within each provider group:
   * Pass 1:
   *   - quota.unified7d != null -> { value: quota.unified7d, provenance: 'unified' }
   *   - else if any of unified7dFable / unified7dSonnet is non-null ->
   *       { value: max(those present), provenance: 'family-proxy' }
   *   - else unresolved.
   * Pass 2:
   *   - unresolved accounts in that group get { value: median(group pass-1 resolved), provenance: 'median' }.
   *   - if that group has NO pass-1 resolved accounts, every account gets { value: 0, provenance: 'empty' }.
   * Median convention: sort ascending; odd count -> middle element; even count -> mean of two middle elements.

   * Priority preemption is checked before this in _select because operator
   * priority is explicit intent that beats the margin.
   *
   * Cycle-freedom proof (adapted from balanced/src/account-manager.js:443-447):
   * In any cycle the total priority change is zero. Preemption edges strictly

   * 1. weeklyBalanceMargin >= 0.02 > 0 strictly (clamps prevent 0, which would
   *    admit A->B->A flapping).
   * 2. W is frozen within a decision: computed once via _computeAllW() and threaded
   *    via `allW` rather than recomputed per comparison.
   * 3. W is model-independent (provider-partitioned weekly metric, not model-dependent).
   * 4. Priority terms stay `<` for preemption and `<=` for margin moves — an account
   *    with strictly lower priority (higher numerical value) is never taken on the margin.
   * 5. _switchOnSessionReset is disabled under balanced (T3), preventing out-of-band
   *    re-ranking moves on equal W or small W differences that would violate the descent.
